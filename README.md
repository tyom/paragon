Paragon
=======

Easy UI prototyping &amp; testing powered by Middleman static generator

Development server and static site generator with isolated styles, mock data and JavaScript.

It's great for quick interaction prototyping, generating styleguides and UI regression testing.

Check `source/prototypes` for example of a prototype and `source/exemplar` for an example which can be set up for UI testing.
